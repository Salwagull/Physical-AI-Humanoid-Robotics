# ROS 2 Diagrams

This directory contains diagrams and visual aids for ROS 2 concepts covered in Chapter 3: ROS 2 Basics.

## Diagrams Needed:

1. **ros2_architecture.svg** - Overall ROS 2 architecture with DDS middleware
2. **pub_sub_pattern.svg** - Publish-subscribe communication pattern
3. **nodes_topics_flow.svg** - Data flow between nodes via topics
4. **service_pattern.svg** - Request-response service communication
5. **computation_graph.svg** - Example ROS 2 computation graph with multiple nodes

## Topics Covered:

- ROS 2 node architecture
- Topic-based publish-subscribe communication
- Service-based request-response communication
- Message passing and data flow
- DDS middleware layer

## Creation Notes:

- Diagrams can be created using tools like draw.io, Figma, or AI generation tools
- Export as SVG for scalability
- Maintain consistent color scheme with Physical AI diagrams
- Use clear labels and annotations
- Show message types and topic names
- Illustrate asynchronous vs synchronous communication patterns

## Status:

- Currently using ASCII diagrams embedded in chapter3_ros2_basics.md
- TODO: Create professional SVG diagrams for production version
- ASCII diagrams serve as placeholders and specification for final graphics
